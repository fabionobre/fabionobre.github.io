I decided to try once again. I'm creating this new blog to share not only about programming and technology but everything I consider interesting,. I will try to post every week. I will try.

Why I decided to start it again?

­- First, I have always liked to share any kind of knowledge and good ideas. 
- Second, I discovered another CMS tool called Jekyll. Jekyll was created in Ruby and Github supports it in its page. So, it is too easy to manage and create content. 
­- Third, I'm deploying in this exact moment a new service created by me, and I think it is good to share with you the goodies and the badies that will happened with this project. It is a way to motivate me. 

Welcome.
