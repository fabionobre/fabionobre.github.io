I'm working as an employee for about 6 years. I have worked in big companies and in small ones. I've worked with a lot of frameworks, new and old and I'm tired of the same type of work, with the same kind of people and doing the same thing. I think it is time to go forward, to work in companies abroad, to do something different with different people working in different cultures.

What is the best or maybe the only way to work like that ? Obviously, it is to work remotely. Why ? 

**Working all over the word:** when you work remotely you can work for any company in the world. In any culture. In any language. 

**No commuting to work:** when you work from home you don't need a car, a bike or bus. You just sit down at your computer and start working, immediately. You can work from home, from a cafe, from the beach, etc.

**Getting paid in dollars or Euros:** when you work remotely you receive your money in dollars or Euros. Maybe you will receive a lot more than if you are working in your country.

This little thing makes me go searching for remote work. I found a great company with great reviews and I applied to work there. This company is called **[Toptal](https://www.toptal.com)** and has a lot of clients all over the world. They have very high standards when recruiting people to work with them, and it is so great because they work only with the best.

I'm so excited to take part in their recruitment process. And when I have more news I will share with you.

Wish me luck!
