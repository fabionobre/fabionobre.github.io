I'm passionate about coding and love to create new things. I'm a Java developer at my 9to5 work and work with Rails on my free time. 

I have at least 5 years experience working as a Java developer and 2+ years with Ruby on Rails. I have a lot of experience creating amazing web enterprise software. 

I love to discover and learn new technologies. Nowadays I'm studying Ionic, AngularJS and MEAN and you can follow my learning in my Github account.

I love working with the latest technologies; writing clean, readable and reusable code and building high performance, highly available and scalable applications.

I have strong knowledge of:

• Java and Ruby on Rails
• Web applications
• REST Web Services
• A lot of Java technologies like Hibernate, JSF, Primefaces, vRaptor.
• Bootstrap, jQuery, CSS, HTML5, JavaScript

I have a strong agile mindset and love to work with Scrum and Kanban.
